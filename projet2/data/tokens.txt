Two roads diverged in a yellow wood , And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler , long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth ; I wandered lonely as a cloud That floats on high o'er vales and hills , When all at once I saw a crowd , A host , of golden daffodils ; Beside the lake , beneath the trees , Fluttering and dancing in the breeze . Hope is the thing with feathers That perches in the soul , And sings the tune without the words , And never stops at all . Shall I compare thee to a summer ’ s day ? Thou art more lovely and more temperate : Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May , And summer ’ s lease hath all too short a date ;
